## Overview

This short-term academic project was conducted as part of a graduate-level course on Radio Astronomy at IIT Kanpur. The aim was to introduce students to hands-on pulsar data analysis using real observations from the **Ooty Radio Telescope (ORT)**. Although my involvement in this project was limited, I have compiled the materials I used, that could be helpful for anyone exploring pulsar studies using ORT data.

## Objectives

- Understand the basic principles of pulsar signal detection and time-series analysis.
- Analyze pulse profiles using raw observational data from ORT.
- Explore how pulsar timing and dispersion can be studied using single-pulse data.
