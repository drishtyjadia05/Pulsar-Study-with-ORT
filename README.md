## Overview

This short-term academic project was conducted as part of a graduate-level course on Radio Astronomy at IIT Kanpur. The aim was to introduce students to hands-on pulsar data analysis using real observations from the **Ooty Radio Telescope (ORT)**. Although my involvement in this project was limited, I have compiled the materials I used, that could be helpful for anyone exploring pulsar studies using ORT data.

## Objectives

- Understand the basic principles of pulsar signal detection and time-series analysis.
- Analyze pulse profiles using raw observational data from ORT.
- Explore how pulsar timing and dispersion can be studied using single-pulse data.

---

## Resources Provided

- Sample pulsar data 
- Jupyter notebooks for plotting time series and pulse profiles
- Notes on basic preprocessing steps
- Reference material for those interested in deeper analysis

---

## Notes

This project is best suited for beginners or students new to pulsar astrophysics. The materials provided are not part of a publication or formal research output, but may serve as a useful starting point for further investigation.
